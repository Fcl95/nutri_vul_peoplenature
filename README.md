**Fish loss in tropical coastal ecosystems can jeopardize nutrient supply to traditional fishing communities: a case study from Northeast Brazil**
(Submitted to *People and Nature*)

This repository provides a reproducible workflow used to:

- Standardize ecological, ecomorphological, and nutritional data of estuarine fishes.

- Compare fish nutrient content with alternative animal protein sources.

- Assess how fish loss could impact nutrient supply for local communities.

- Perform statistical analyses including permutation tests, PCA, and trait-based comparisons.
